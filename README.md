Connect Four Game

This project is a simple implementation of the classic two-player game, Connect Four. It allows two players to take turns placing their tokens (X and O) on a game board.
The game checks for win conditions in various directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and also handles a draw when the game board is full.
Players are prompted to input the column number for their moves, and the game provides feedback and updates the board accordingly.
Enjoy a game of strategy and skill with Connect Four!
